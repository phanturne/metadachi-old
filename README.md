## Deployment Guide
<details>

<summary>Hosted Quickstart (Vercel + Supabase)</summary>

Follow these steps to get your own Metadaci instance running in the cloud.

### 1. Clone or fork the repo
Forking the repo will make it easier to receive updates.

Clone:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/phanturne/metadachi.git
```

Fork:
Use the fork button in the upper right corner of the GitHub page.

### 2. Install dependencies
Open a terminal in the root directory of your local repository and run:

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Set up backend with Supabase
#### a. Create a new project
Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.

#### b. Get project values
Once you are in the project dashboard, click on the "Project Settings" icon tab on the far bottom left.

Here you will get the values for the following environment variables:

- `Project Ref`: Found in "General settings" as "Reference ID"

- `Project ID`: Found in the URL of your project dashboard (Ex: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/settings/general)

While still in "Settings" click on the "API" text tab on the left.

Here you will get the values for the following environment variables:

- `Project URL`: Found in "API Settings" as "Project URL"
- `Anon key`: Found in "Project API keys" as "anon public"
- `Service role key`: Found in "Project API keys" as "service_role" (Reminder: Treat this like a password!)

#### 4. Configure auth
Next, click on the "Authentication" icon tab on the far left.

In the text tabs, click on "Providers" and make sure "Email" is enabled.

We recommend turning off "Confirm email" for your own personal instance.

#### 5. Connect to hosted database
Open up your repository for your hosted instance of Metadachi.

In the 1st migration file `supabase/migrations/20240108234540_setup.sql` you will need to replace 2 values with the values you got above:

- `project_url` (line 53): Use the `Project URL` value from above
- `service_role_key` (line 54): Use the `Service role key` value from above

Now, open a terminal in the root directory of your local Metadachi repository. We will execute a few commands here.

Login to Supabase by running:

```sh
supabase login
```

Next, link your project by running the following command with the "Project Ref" and "Project ID" you got above:

```sh
supabase link --project-ref <project-id>
```

Your project should now be linked.

Finally, push your database to Supabase by running:

```sh
supabase db push
```

Your hosted database should now be set up!

### 4. [Optional] Configure website settings
Open the `app/lib/config.ts` file and change any of the variables.

Commit and push your changes.

### 5. Set up frontend with Vercel
Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and create a new project.

In the setup page, import your GitHub repository for your hosted instance of Metadachi.

In environment variables, add the following from the values you got above:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_OLLAMA_URL` (only needed when using local Ollama models; default: `http://localhost:11434`)

[Optional] You can also add API keys as environment variables.

For the full list of environment variables, refer to the '.env.local.example' file.

Click "Deploy" and wait for your frontend to deploy.

Once deployed, you should be able to use your hosted instance of Metadachi via the URL Vercel gives you.

<summary>Local Quickstart</summary>

Follow these steps to get your own instance running locally.

### 1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/phanturne/metadachi.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Open a terminal in the root directory of your local repository and run:

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Install Supabase & run locally
#### a. Install Docker
You will need to install Docker to run Supabase locally. You can download it [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) for free.

#### b. Install Supabase CLI
**MacOS/Linux**
```sh
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
```

**Windows**
```sh
scoop bucket add supabase https://github.com/supabase/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install supabase
```

#### 3. Start Supabase
In your terminal at the root of your local repository, run:

```sh
supabase start
```

### 4. [Optional] Configure website settings
Open the `/lib/config.ts` file and change any of the variables.

Commit and push your changes.

### 5. Fill in secrets
#### a. Environment variables
In your terminal at the root of your local repository, run:

```sh
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Get the required values by running:

```sh
supabase status
```

Note: Use `API URL` from `supabase status` for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`

Now go to your `.env.local` file and fill in the values.

If the environment variable is set, it will disable the input in the user settings.

#### b. SQL setup
In the 1st migration file `supabase/migrations/20240108234540_setup.sql` you will need to replace 2 values with the values you got above:

- `project_url` (line 53): `http://supabase_kong_chatbotui:8000` (default) can remain unchanged if you don't change your `project_id` in the `config.toml` file
- `service_role_key` (line 54): You got this value from running `supabase status`

This prevents issues with storage files not being deleted properly.

### 6. [Optional] Install Ollama for local models
Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama#macos).

### 7. Run locally
In your terminal at the root of your local repository, run:

```sh
npm run chat
```

Your local instance should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can view your backend GUI at [http://localhost:54323/project/default/editor](http://localhost:54323/project/default/editor).
